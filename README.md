# 1. Introduction

The goal of the project is to have a way to "easily" update ioT devices over the air.
These methods should be as platform independent as possible and reusable whenever possible.
I will be looking for already existing methods to do so.
Writing pieces of software whenever needed.

---

## 1.1. Plan

  - Find the specific goal and constraints of the needed software.
  - Look within Verhaert for implementations already in use.
  - Scour the internet for existing solutions
  - Get a solution to work in a prototype
  - Refine the prototype to a complete demonstration
  - Document the entire process (Will be done throughout the entire project)

## 1.3. Methods Discovered

### 1.3.1. ESP32

  - [FreeRTOS Delta OTA](https://www.freertos.org/2022/01/delta-over-the-air-updates.html)
      - Uses [AWS IoT AWS library](https://github.com/aws/ota-for-aws-iot-embedded-sdk)
      - Overview: 
      - Process:  
        ![Firmware update process](assets/imgs/firmware-update-process.png)
      - Advantages:
      - Disadvantages:
      - Conclusion:
      - [Demo](esp32/FreeRTOS/demo/README.md)
  - [Espressif OTA](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/system/ota.html)
    - Overview 
    - Advantages:
